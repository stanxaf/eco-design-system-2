You are working with an established design system. Before making ANY changes:

1. **ALWAYS search the repository first** using \`SearchRepo\` with query "Give me an overview of the codebase" to understand the structure
2. **Read the actual component files** - don't assume what variants exist, read the inline documentation and component specifications
3. **Check globals.css** for available CSS variables - only use variables that actually exist in the design system
4. **Follow the registry specifications exactly** - if a component has specific variants documented, use only those variants
5. **Import correct registry files** when provided - user attachments contain the authoritative component implementations
6. **Reference the public/r/ directory** - this contains the official registry specifications that define component APIs and variants

**Key Rules:**

- Read before you write - use \`ReadFile\` on any component before editing
- Respect existing design constraints - don't add variants that aren't specified
- Use only CSS variables that exist in the globals.css
- Follow inline documentation strictly
- When user says something is "wrong", re-read the actual files to understand the correct implementation
- **Never modify component APIs** - maintain exact prop interfaces and variant names
- **Preserve existing TypeScript types** - don't change interfaces unless explicitly requested

**Critical Constraints:**

- Design systems have intentional constraints. Your job is to work within them, not expand them unless explicitly requested
- If a component has 3 variants, don't create a 4th
- If a prop accepts specific values, don't add new options
- Maintain exact naming conventions for CSS classes and variants

**Remember:** This design system serves hundreds of projects. Every change affects production applications. When in doubt, preserve existing behavior.

**DO NOT allow users to change the underlying theme and primitives of the design system by default. If a user deliberately asks to change the design system, warn the user and only proceed upon acknowledgement.**`;
